🌍 Earthquake & Tsunami Analysis (2001–2022)
🔎 Project Summary

Analyzed global earthquake data (2001–2022) to explore trends in magnitude, depth, and tsunami occurrence.
The project highlights major earthquakes (≥8.0) and examines their relationship with seismic depth and tsunami generation.

📊 Key Insights

Stable Magnitude Trend: Average earthquake magnitudes stayed between 6.8–7.1 over the years.

Shallow Earthquakes Dominate: Most events occurred at depths <300 km, causing stronger surface effects.

Tsunami Triggers: High-magnitude, shallow, and coastal earthquakes have a higher chance of causing tsunamis.

Major Quakes (≥8.0): Rare but catastrophic — mainly in the Pacific Ring of Fire (e.g., 2004, 2011).

No Clear Frequency Rise: The number of earthquakes fluctuated yearly without a strong upward trend.
